#Golden-Pizza Project (Angular + node.js)
This project is a dashboard project and this project took from me around (500 hours) 
I used (Angular & node.js) in this project.

*The first page is for the main page (information about the project & personal information) if you want a quick contact with me please click on my number 
*The menu page is for the products and the cart and there is a button for login and if you are an admin there is a button that will appear named in ( dashboard ) to get full access to the project
If you want to login as an admin take this :
*Email: admin@gmail.com
*Pass:123 
*If you are not logged in, you will be able to add to the cart but you cannot check the order
*If you want to order in the right way, please log in with an email and don't forget to verify the email by clicking on the link I will send to you on the email
When you go to the dashboard page you will find 5 buttons to be able to access the project (add product, update product, delete a product, user info, block user)
####In Add product: you can add a product to any section by clicking on that button which adds to the section
####In delete product: you can delete any product in the project by ID
####In update product: you can update a product by choose his ID from tables IDs and put your changes and clicking on submit button 
####In block user: you can block any user by adding his (email or phone) 
####In get user information: you can get any user information by adding his (email or phone)





#### hint:
Maybe you will find a problem with the project (link && images) because itâ€™s on a free host
